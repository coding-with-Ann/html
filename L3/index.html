LAYOUTS
Sometimes we have to use tags whose effect can't be seen on webpage but they effect the internal working of the webpage and the ranking of webpage.

HTML HAS TWO TYPES OF TAGS 
1. SEMANTIC TAGS       -- THESE TAGS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD JUST BY SEEING THEM 
HEADER, MAIN AND FOOTER
THESE TAGS MAKES THE CODE MORE READABLE, GIVES GOOD UX AND GOOD SEO.

2. NON SEMANTIC TAGS   -- CANT SAY WHAT IT IS BY SEEING THEM (LIKE DIV SPAN)

PAGE LAYOUT TECHNIQUES
using semantic tags for layout

Three types of tags can be used in main tag
1. Section tag <section> to make sections like movies, webseries, anime etc. all these can be written as sections.
2. Article tag <article>
3. Aside tag <aside>     -- for content aside main content(ads)
4. achor tag <a href = "Link" target = "_main"><a/>
       target is a attribute, _main opens the link in new tab


Non semantic Tags

Div Tag
Div is a container for other HTML elements
Div can be used when we want to make changes for collective elements at once. 
Everything written inside div is like everything inside one box.
Block elements takes the full width.
<div>, <p>, <hr> <header>,main, <footer>, <pre> etc are block tags

Span Tag
Span Tag is also a container used for other HTML elements.
In a paragraph, If we want to make changes to a sentence then we can use span tag.
Inline elements takes width as per their size.
<a> , <br>, <img>, <button>, <span>, <big>, <small>, <b>, <i> etc are inline tags
